## About Me

<img src="/images/lawrence.JPG" class="floatpic" width="413" height="531">

Hello, here is **Chen Nan (Lawrence, ÈôàÊ•†)**.

I am a Ph.D. candidate at The University of Hong Kong (HKUüè´), [<font color=blue>MaRS LAB</font>](https://mars.hku.hk/), supervised by [<font color=blue>Dr. Fu Zhang</font>](https://www.mech.hku.hk/academic-staff/Zhang-F) and co-supervised by [<font color=blue>Prof. James Lam</font>](https://meweb.hku.hk/jlam/). My research interests lie on the areas of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) design, control, and autonomous navigation.

I am the author of 14 published papers (**1 Science Robotics**, **1 T-IE**, **1 T-MECH**, **2 IJRR**, **2 RA-L**, **1 AIS**, **1 T-MAG**, **1 ICRA**, **3 IROS**, **1 PESA**).
